zabbix-map-creation
===================

A script to create a zabbix map from a graphviz.dot file (http://blog.zabbix.com/maps-for-the-lazy/2898/)


This is code updated from:
http://blog.zabbix.com/maps-for-the-lazy/2898/

But tweaked to allow custom username, password, host, file to parse, etc.  It also does an update instead of a delete and create, so that URL's don't change.
